! Queries for subdomains of secshow.net are from a spoofed IP on the same subnet as the resolver.
! The subdomain fingerprints the request to determine which resolvers forward the requests.
! They aren't the only ones. This list includes those entries in my DNS records which attempt
!   to perform such tracking.
